# Vending Machine Controller ‚Äì RTL Design

This project is a Verilog RTL-based implementation of a configurable vending machine controller. It simulates a real vending system, supporting dynamic item setup, asynchronous user input, and real-time dispensing logic.

---

## Features

- Supports up to **1024 unique items**
- **APB-like configuration interface** (10 MHz)
- Real-time **operation mode** on a 100 MHz system clock
- Handles **asynchronous currency and item select inputs** (10 kHz ‚Äì 50 MHz)
- Dispenses items within **10 system clock cycles**
- Returns change if overpaid
- Modular and clean RTL architecture

## üîÅ Operating Modes

### 1. Reset Mode
- Initializes all internal memories and registers.

### 2. Configuration Mode
- Item setup via APB-like interface:
  - Set total items
  - Configure item price
  - Set availability
- Configuration data is safely synchronized from `pclk` to `system_clk`.

### 3. Operation Mode
- Processes currency and item selection.
- Compares inserted amount with item price.
- Dispenses item and returns change if needed.
- Ensures vending decision in under 10 cycles.

## üìÇ Module Overview

- `fsm`: Controls system mode transitions (Reset, Config, Operation)
- `cfg_block`: Handles APB-based configuration and clock domain crossing
- `operation_controller`: Performs runtime vending logic
- `vending_machine_top`: Top-level integration and memory coordination
